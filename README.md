# BetterCards
Flashcard website that allows for importing cards, studing using "knowledge" based learning, and flipped cards
I made this website because flashcard websites/ apps are nice but have some limitations I wanted to add, including the flipped card learning, which I find very useful for learning a new language. 

I also coded this just to reinforce javascript skills and build an actual website from the ground up. This was a fun project and learned as I built. I also just wanted to learn more and use the localStorage functionality, I found this website not too dificult to create. In the future I might look to learn more about tailwind css or some way to add transitions and format my code a bit better, from the lots of constants.
